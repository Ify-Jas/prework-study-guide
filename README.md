# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide webpage is a webpage I created as a first project to document what I have learnt so far in my quest to become a Front End Developer.
It contains basic understandings of the programming languages I have used so far(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and it also contains some Git/Github.
I hope to update it as I learn so that it will not only be a reference point for me but for others who may be looking to become Front End Developers.
This is a good stepping stone but has also opened my up to the amount of work required to achieve my career aim. I struggled a bit with the idea of GitFlow but with more work I will be able to understand fully.
